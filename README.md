##Design Process
External user's goal:
The site's users are fans and potential fans who would like to know more about Harry's background, achievements and current activities, and possibly book them for shows.
Site owner's goal:
The site owner is interested in getting more fans interested in Harry Styles to increase his popularity as well as get more performances
When fans think of Harry, they think of electrifying performances with dark stadiums only illuminated by a few spotlights. I wanted to ensure I kept the vibe of that and so I ensured that the background and the overall theme of the website was dark. I also added videos playing in the background (eg. on the bottom part of the homepage) to make the website more lively and different from the usual static image, as well as scroll animations to make the design more interactive.
